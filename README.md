This is an add on to project 2: Responsiveness Portfolio.... 
Which had the following: 

Created three HTML's. One for that's about me, one that's got a my portfolio & another with a my contact numbers. 
All of these screen SHOULD be responsive to any type of device.
All of these web sites are connected thru a nav menu.

This update left the contact page alone. 
Updated the About page with more updated information. 
Updated the Portfolio page with 3 actual projects.
Added a Card page with all of my contact info.   

You should be able to find the screens on...
